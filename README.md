# Spider Revisited

This is the Spider of the SearchSECO project. The Spider is responsible for retrieving all relevant data (source files, author data and project metadata) from (Git-based) sources on the internet and comminicating this data to the Controller component of the system. The spider needs a stable connection to the source in question to be able to clone projects, to then process these locally.
